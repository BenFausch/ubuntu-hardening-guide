# UBUNTU/APACHE HARDENING GUIDE

This is a ubuntu/Apache setup guide I've been putting together over the last few years. I recently went through several ubuntu hardening guides, including the guide from the [National Cyber Security Centre](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/end-user-device-security/platform-specific-guidance/ubuntu-18-04-lts) and [The Book of Zeus](http://bookofzeus.com/harden-ubuntu/).
  
This guide is for Ubuntu 18.04 with Apache, which has several security improvements and security measures that I have enacted from the mentioned sources and a few others.
